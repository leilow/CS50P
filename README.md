**NOTES**

Troubleshooting
- How to use terminal (in and out of VSCode) to execute command-line code to `mkdir` (create new dir), `cd` (create new folder) and `code example.py`(create new file).
- How to use terminal to check my answer or submit using `check50` and `submit50`.

Concepts I'm Still Learning
- How to make programs work when creating functions. I often run into NameErrors, and *feel* like the program is more legible/shorter without functions.
- "Pythonic" way of doing things. Takes me a while to get to a solution that's concise and pythonic.
